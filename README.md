## Smart Contract Modules

### Key Contracts
- `QualityRegistry.sol`: Quality data management
- `SensorOracle.sol`: IoT data verification
- `QualityTokenRewards.sol`: Incentive mechanism
- `QualityThresholdManager.sol`: Dynamic quality standards
- `DisputeResolution.sol`: Conflict management

### Quality Data Structure
```javascript
struct QualityRecord {
  productId: string;
  manufacturer: address;
  batchNumber: string;
  collectionTimestamp: uint256;
  sensorMetrics: {
    temperature: float;
    humidity: float;
    vibration: float;
    chemicalComposition: string;
  }
  qualityScore: uint8;
  status: QualityStatus;
  certificationHash: string;
}

enum QualityStatus {
  PENDING,
  APPROVED,
  REJECTED,
  REQUIRES_INVESTIGATION
}
```
